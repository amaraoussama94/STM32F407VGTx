# STM32F407VGTx
I used  for  this  project Coocox
you can find all the part of the project(BEHW): +Dashboard of a car based STM 32f4:
            -Variation of the speed of a fan by the variation of a potentiometer (ADC, PMW)
            -Measurement of the fan speed by the principle of frequency hashing.
            -Temperature measurement by IC DS1621 and use of IC DS1307 to recover time and date (I2C, USART).
            -Transfer of data disputes to a cloud by ESP8266 (USART).
for schematic  you  can ask me, but  it's simple project just use a 10Kohm resistor for I2C (I don't  use pull up of the stem)
f there s any add I will be thankful to improve this project 
open score project enjoy
